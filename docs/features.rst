========

- **Universal Audio Capture**  
  Record mic, system audio, or any combination via BlackHole (macOS) or equivalent loopback drivers.

- **Manual Control**  
  Start/Stop buttons let you define exactly the boundaries of your prompt—perfect for long, multi-sentence queries.

- **One-Shot Transcription**  
  Whisper processes the entire recording in a single call—no fragmented sentences.

- **Live AI Streaming**  
  Gemini’s response appears token by token, just like in ChatGPT’s streaming interface.

- **Configurable Model**  
  Swap between Gemini variants via environment (no code changes).

- **Zero-Install UI Bootstrapping**  
  On first run `voxai` auto-installs the minimal Electron UI source—included in the PyPI package—so you only ever need `pip install voxai` and `voxai`.
